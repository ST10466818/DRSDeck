## FAQ's

### How does the app work?

You’ll be presented with 5 true/false questions per round. After you answer all the questions you get to see your score at the end along with a race-inspired message (like “P1 finish!” or “DNF ”). 

### Do I need internet to play? 

Nope! The quiz works offline. Just launch the app and start racing through those questions.

### Can I replay the quiz?

Absolutely! You can retake the quiz as many times as you like. In future we'd like to add a feature where you'll be presented with different questions to broaden your knowledge.

### How is my score calculated?

Each correct answer earns 1 point. Your final score out of 5 determines your race result message (e.g. “P3 – Podium finish!”).

### Who is this app for?

Whether you're a new fan who just learned about DRS or a die-hard who still misses the V10s , this app is made for every kind of F1 enthusiast.
